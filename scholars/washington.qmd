#### Topics covered

Professor Washington's training is in ordinary and partial differential equations which she applies to problems in biology and engineering.  Recently, however, her efforts have been to facilitate data science at the Atlanta University Center, a consortium consisting of Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, and Spelman College. They organize workshops, summer programs, learning communities, data challenges, and funding opportunities.
