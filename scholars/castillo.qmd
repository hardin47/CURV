In an <a href = "https://blogs.ams.org/mathmentoringnetwork/2020/07/31/staying-the-path-motivation-through-graduate-school/" target = "_blank">interview</a> done by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/mathswagger/home" target = "_blank">Math SWAGGER (The Mathematics Summer Workshop for Achieving Greater Graduate Educational Readiness)</a>, Castillo tells us:

>I can’t help but think about how helpful having these conversations would have been prior to beginning graduate school. This is why I am very excited to learn and share what I’ve learned with incoming graduate students.
