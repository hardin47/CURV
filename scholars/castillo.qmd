# Alejandra Castillo

In an <a href = "https://blogs.ams.org/mathmentoringnetwork/2020/07/31/staying-the-path-motivation-through-graduate-school/" target = "_blank">interview</a> done by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/mathswagger/home" target = "_blank">Math SWAGGER (The Mathematics Summer Workshop for Achieving Greater Graduate Educational Readiness)</a>, Castillo tells us:

>I can’t help but think about how helpful having these conversations would have been prior to beginning graduate school. This is why I am very excited to learn and share what I’ve learned with incoming graduate students.

#### Topics covered

Castillo's research lies at the intersection of unsupervised learning, dimension reduction, and inference, with applications in clinical trial design.  Some of her work explores how to use baseline demographic information collected before randomization to a clinical trial, particularly as the baseline information changes during the course of the trial.  Her more recent work investigates sparse solutions to clustering problems.
