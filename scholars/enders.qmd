#### Topics covered

With close to 200 publications, she has worked closely with clinicians, with particular focus on women's health and psychology. Across the medical spectrum, Dr. Enders has provided advanced statistical modeling collaboration in clinical trials.  Her methods include many of those that are covered in undergraduate courses: regression, logistic regression, survival analysis, cross validation.

She is also passionate about biostatistics education and works to dissolve the hidden curriculum for research, particularly statistical knowledge needed for non-statisticians.  Dr. Enders has identified hidden curriculum topics that disproportionately affect historically underrepresented clinicians, and she works to provide access to gaining needed skills.
