#### Topics covered

Dr. Jackson's main area of research is in spatial statistics, particularly applied to disease surveillance.  Her methods seek to detect, for example, cancer clusters and other spatially related diseases.  Among other tools, she uses simulations to set up different correlated spatial structures in order to make inferences about the research questions at hand.
