# Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen

Dr. Tchetgen Tchetgen received his BS from Yale University in 1999 and his PhD in Biostatistics from Harvard University in 2006. He is University Professor at Penn, holding joint appointments as Professor of Biostatistics at the Perelman School of Medicine and Professor of Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School, where he co-directs the Center for Causal Inference.

Dr. Tchetgen Tchetgen is a leader in causal inference. He was part of the team that received the <a href = "https://imstat.org/2022/07/18/rousseeuw-prize-winners-announced/" target = "_blank">Rousseeuw Prize for Statistics</a> in 2022 — a $1 million prize rewarding excellent statistical research with an important impact. He also won the David Cox Medal, in 2025.

#### Topics covered

Dr. Tchetgen Tchetgen works on the development of statistical and epidemiologic methods that make efficient use of the information in data collected by scientific investigators, while avoiding unnecessary assumptions about the underlying data generating mechanism. Specifically, his primary research interests are in semi-parametric efficiency theory with application to causal inference, missing data problems, statistical genetics, and mixed model theory. He is also involved in research related to HIV/AIDS.

> Causal mediation analysis decomposes the effect of an exposure/treatment on an outcome into a direct effect and an indirect (mediated) effect. This paper devleops a semiparametric framework for causal mediation analysis, characterizing efficiency bounds and providing multiply robust estimators that remain consistent under partial model misspecification.

> A persistent worry in observational studies is that an apparent relationship between an exposure and an outcome might be driven by a hidden confounding variable. This paper proposes building in "negative controls" — exposures or outcomes that are known to have no true causal relationship — as a tool for detecting unmeasured confounding. If your analysis detects an effect where there should be none, that's a signal that confounding is distorting your results. The approach is simple enough to be applied routinely and has since become influential in epidemiologic research.
