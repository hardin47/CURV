#### Topics covered

As a statistician at the Census Bureau (for over 20 years), Paisano was responsible for developing enumeration formulas that changed the way tribes were being counted in the census.  In particular, after her work was implemented, the number of Native Americans counted in the 1990 census went up 38% (as compared to the 1980 census). The recalculation of population numbers changed the way that funding was allocated to Native Americans via federal programs.
