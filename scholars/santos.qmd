# Robert Santos

Robert Santos received an MA in Statistics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  He served as president of the American Statistical Association in 2021.  As a survey researcher, he worked at National Opinion Research Center (NORC, University of Chicago) and the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. From <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Institute" target = "_blank">wikipedia</a>: The Urban Institute measures policy effects, compares options, shows which stakeholders get the most and least, tests conventional wisdom, reveals trends, and makes costs, benefits, and risks explicit.


As a Mexican-American, he is the first non-white person to serve as the Director of the US Census Bureau (appointed by Joe Biden and approved by the US Senate in 2022).
