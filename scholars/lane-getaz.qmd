# Sharon Lane-Getaz

Dr. Lane-Getaz majored in mathematics at Trenton State College where she earned an undergraduate degree. During her senior year she did two things: she took a graduate class in applied mathematics at Harvard University and worked at IBM during a summer internship. The IBM internship turned into a full-time job where she stayed for more than a dozen years.

A personal situation brought Dr. Lane-Getaz to Minnesota where she found herself engaged in teaching, first in middle and high school. Eventually she went back to graduate school and received a PhD in Statistics Education from the University of Minnesota. The majority of her teaching career was at St. Olaf college where she became the first Black woman to be promoted to the rank of Full Professor. While at St. Olaf, Dr. Lane-Getaz served as a Posse Mentor, and she is now Professor Emerita.
