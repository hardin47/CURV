# David Blackwell

Blackwell was the first black person to receive a PhD in statistics in the US and the first black scholar to be admitted to the National Academy of Sciences.
He was a statistician at UC Berkeley for more than 50 years. He was hired in 1954 after the department almost made him an offer in 1942 (but declined to do so when one faculty member's wife said she didn't want Blackwell hired because she wouldn't feel comfortable having faculty events in her home with a black man).
