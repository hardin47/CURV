#### Topics covered

Dr. Sellers' primary research area is in the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) model, a generalization of the Poisson model that does not require the mean and the variance of the distribution to be equal. The COM-Poisson model is used in myriad applications due to its flexibility and ability to model real-world applications.  Dr. Sellers has written about the work in regression settings, clustered categorical data, and correlated data.  The work culminates in a Cambridge text, **The Conway–Maxwell–Poisson Distribution**. She and collaborators have also created four R packages -  `COMPoissonReg`, `cmpprocess`, `multicmp`, and `CMPControl` - so that analysts can seamlessly apply her work in data applications.
