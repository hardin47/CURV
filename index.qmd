title: "CURV - connecting, uplifting, and recognizing voices"
---


CURV is a project designed to connect statisticians and data scientists to undergraduate curricula.
Amplifying voices which are often marginalized helps all of us to build a larger community of scholars inclusive of every voice.  

In particular, one of the major goals of the database is to lower the barrier to presenting examples of all types of scholars to our students.
You might use the database with a "Statistician of the Day" activity.
Or you might have students bring into the classroom one idea connecting a scholar to the class content.

There are many good resources highlighting statisticians, data scientists, and mathematicians who are traditionally underrepresented.
I've listed just a few here, I encourage you and your students to check them out!
