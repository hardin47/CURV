    "section": "",
    "text": "CURV is a project designed to connect statisticians and data scientists to undergraduate curricula. Amplifying voices which are often marginalized helps all of us to build a larger community of scholars inclusive of every voice.\nIn particular, one of the major goals of the database is to lower the barrier to presenting examples of all types of scholars to our students. You might use the database with a “Statistician of the Day” activity. Or you might have students bring into the classroom one idea connecting a scholar to the class content.\nSee the CURV blog entry for motivation and use in the classroom.\nThere are many good resources highlighting statisticians, data scientists, and mathematicians who are traditionally underrepresented. I’ve listed just a few here, I encourage you and your students to check them out!\n\nMathematicians of the African Diaspora is dedicated to promoting and highlighting the contributions of members of the African diaspora to mathematics, especially contributions to current mathematical research.\nJustice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Outreach Group, a community of statisticians and data scientists, is committed to communication, programming, and professional development to advance and support a society that values all people.\nData for Black Lives movement of activists, organizers, and scientists committed to the mission of using data to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people.\nWe All Count Extensive guidelines for data inclusivity.\nGayta Science Data stories / data viz / data analysis / data science on gender fluidity.\nInclusivity Resource Building Gender and Sexuality Allyship in the Mathematics Community.\nMathematically Gifted and Black celebrates mathematicians from the African diaspora across the mathematical sciences.\nLathisms A vibrant, inclusive, and diverse Mathematical community where the Latinx and Hispanic culture is valued, cultivated, and celebrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribute? Yes, please!\nCertainly, if you are here, then you have ideas which could be added to make this resource even better. Feel free to peruse the CURV GitHub repo. I welcome pull requests, or create an issue and I’ll incorporate your suggestions directly into the database. Thank you in advance!\n\n\nContributors\nThe project would not have been possible without the help from many others. Thank you to all who have contributed, including:\nEdray Goins, and Tianna Couch.\n\nCreated by Jo Hardin, Professor of Mathematics & Statistics at Pomona College."

The Census Bureau planned to use sampling (instead of straight enumeration) in the 2000 census. There was clear evidence that sampling would better evaluate the true number of people in each district in the United States. In 1998 the US House of Representatives filed a lawsuit against the Department of Commerce with the argument that sampling is unconstitutional. In 1998 the Supreme Court decided for the plaintiffs, and the 2000 census did not have any sampling.

As an undesirable consequence, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on asymptotic normality can lead to erroneous results. We propose a family of online debiasing estimators to correct these distributional anomalies in least squares estimation. Our proposed methods take advantage of the covariance structure present in the dataset and provide sharper estimates in directions for which more information has accrued. We establish an asymptotic normality property for our proposed online debiasing estimators under mild conditions on the data collection process and provide asymptotically exact confidence intervals…\n\n\nPierre Bayle, Alexandre Bayle, Lucas Janson, and Lester Mackey, Cross-validation Confidence Intervals for Test Error Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), December 2020.\n\n\nThis work develops central limit theorems for cross-validation and consistent estimators of its asymptotic variance under weak stability conditions on the learning algorithm. Together, these results provide practical, asymptotically-exact confidence intervals for k-fold test error and valid, powerful hypothesis tests of whether one learning algorithm has smaller k-fold test error than another. These results are also the first of their kind for the popular choice of leave-one-out cross-validation.
