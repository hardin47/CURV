    "section": "",
    "text": "CURV is a project designed to connect statisticians and data scientists to undergraduate curricula. Amplifying voices which are often marginalized helps all of us to build a larger community of scholars inclusive of every voice.\nIn particular, one of the major goals of the database is to lower the barrier to presenting examples of all types of scholars to our students. You might use the database with a “Statistician of the Day” activity. Or you might have students bring into the classroom one idea connecting a scholar to the class content.\nThere are many good resources highlighting statisticians, data scientists, and mathematicians who are traditionally underrepresented. I’ve listed just a few here, I encourage you and your students to check them out!\n\nMathematicians of the African Diaspora is dedicated to promoting and highlighting the contributions of members of the African diaspora to mathematics, especially contributions to current mathematical research.\nJustice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Outreach Group, a community of statisticians and data scientists, is committed to communication, programming, and professional development to advance and support a society that values all people.\nData for Black Lives movement of activists, organizers, and scientists committed to the mission of using data to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people.\nWe All Count Extensive guidelines for data inclusivity.\nGayta Science Data stories / data viz / data analysis / data science on gender fluidity.\nInclusivity Resource Building Gender and Sexuality Allyship in the Mathematics Community.\nMathematically Gifted and Black celebrates mathematicians from the African diaspora across the mathematical sciences.\nLathisms A vibrant, inclusive, and diverse Mathematical community where the Latinx and Hispanic culture is valued, cultivated, and celebrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribute? Yes, please!\nCertainly, if you are here, then you have ideas which could be added to make this resource even better. Feel free to peruse the CURV GitHub repo. I welcome pull requests, or create an issue and I’ll incorporate your suggestions directly into the database. Thank you in advance!\n\n\nContributors\nThe project would not have been possible without the help from many others. Thank you to all who have contributed, including:\nEdray Goins, and Tianna Couch.\n\nCreated by Jo Hardin, Professor of Mathematics & Statistics at Pomona College."

They not only speak to the progress that had been made, but they centered many of the challenges that continued to exist at the time. The set of visualizations demonstrate how powerfully a picture can tell 1000 words, as the information Du Bois used was primarily available from public records (e.g., census and other government reports).\nWhitney Battle-Baptiste and Britt Rusert have reproduced and narrated the images from the exhibit in W.E.B.
